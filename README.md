A feature-rich, responsive web application designed to help students organize their academic tasks. This isn't just a simple to-do list; it's a powerful tool with features like multiple list management, custom categories, task prioritization, and automatic sorting to ensure the most important tasks are always front and center.

## ✨ Features

This project was built from the ground up and includes a wide range of modern web application features:

*   **📝 Multiple List Management:**
    *   Create multiple, separate to-do lists for different subjects or projects.
    *   Switch between lists seamlessly with a dropdown menu.
    *   Delete entire lists with a confirmation step to prevent accidental data loss.

*   **🚀 Advanced Task Organization:**
    *   **Custom Categories:** Create your own categories (e.g., "Reading," "Lab Report," "Practice") on the fly for each list.
    *   **Task Priorities:** Assign **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** priority to each task.
    *   **Automatic Smart Sorting:** Tasks are automatically sorted using a three-tiered system:
        1.  **Completion Status** (incomplete tasks are always at the top).
        2.  **Priority** (High > Medium > Low).
        3.  **Due Date** (earliest first).

*   **📊 Dynamic UI & UX:**
    *   **Visual Indicators:** Priorities are clearly marked with colors, and overdue tasks are highlighted in red.
    *   **Progress Tracking:** A visual progress bar shows the completion percentage for the currently active list.
    *   **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and provides a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
    *   **"Completed On" Date:** When a task is completed, it is pushed to the bottom and the completion date is recorded and displayed.

*   **💾 Data Persistence:**
    *   The entire application state, including all lists and tasks, is saved to the browser's **Local Storage**, so your data is always there when you return.
