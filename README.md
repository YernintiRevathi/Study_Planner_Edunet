## ‚ú® Features

This project was built from the ground up and includes a wide range of modern web application features:

*   **üìù Multiple List Management:**
    *   Create, switch between, and manage separate to-do lists for different subjects or projects.
    *   Delete entire lists with a confirmation step to prevent accidental data loss.

*   **üöÄ Advanced Task Organization:**
    *   **Custom Categories:** Create your own categories (e.g., "Reading," "Lab Report," "Practice") on the fly for each list.
    *   **Task Priorities:** Assign **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** priority to each task.
    *   **Automatic Smart Sorting:** Tasks are automatically sorted using a three-tiered system:
        1.  **Completion Status** (incomplete tasks are always at the top).
        2.  **Priority** (High > Medium > Low).
        3.  **Due Date** (earliest first).

*   **üìä Dynamic UI & UX:**
    *   **Reminders:** Get native desktop notifications for tasks that are due today.
    *   **Visual Calendar:** Switch to a full-page calendar view (powered by FullCalendar.js) to see all your tasks visually laid out by due date.
    *   **Visual Indicators:** Priorities are clearly marked with colors, and overdue tasks are highlighted in red.
    *   **Progress Tracking:** A visual progress bar shows the completion percentage for the currently active list.
    *   **"Completed On" Date:** When a task is completed, its priority is automatically downgraded, and the completion date is recorded and displayed.
    *   **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

*   **üíæ Data Persistence:**
    *   The entire application state, including all lists, tasks, and settings, is saved to the browser's **Local Storage**, so your data is always there when you return.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project was built entirely with foundational web technologies, demonstrating a strong command of core front-end development skills.

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the application.
*   **CSS3:** For all styling, including modern features like Flexbox for layout and a mobile-first, responsive design approach.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the logic and interactivity. No frameworks were used, showcasing a deep understanding of:
    *   DOM Manipulation
    *   State Management (using a single state object)
    *   Event Handling and Delegation
    *   Browser APIs (Local Storage, Notification API)
    *   Data Structures and complex sorting algorithms
*   **FullCalendar.js:** Integrated as a third-party library to provide the powerful calendar view functionality.
